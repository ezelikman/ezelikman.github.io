I'm an incoming Stanford CS PhD student (and Symbolic Systems graduate) fascinated by how (and whether) algorithms can learn meaningful representations. Perhaps the most <s>daunting</s> exciting gap between biological and machine learning is the ease with which we learn to create and apply concepts about our world from experience: not only do we need much <i>less</i> experience to construct these concepts, but our understanding is <b>flexible</b> in novel situations, <b>robust</b> to slight changes, and generally <b>disentangled</b>. 

Ultimately, I hope machine learning can teach us about non-machine learning and help us overcome the challenges facing humanity.

Also, I love baking bread, cooking, and exploring nature!
